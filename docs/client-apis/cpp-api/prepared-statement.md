# PreparedStatement
`PreparedStatement` is a parameterized query which can avoid planning the same query for repeated execution.  

## Example
```
auto preparedStatement = conn->prepare("MATCH (a:person) WHERE a.isStudent = $1 RETURN COUNT(*)");
auto result = conn->execute(preparedStatement.get(), std::make_pair(std::string("1"), true));
```
