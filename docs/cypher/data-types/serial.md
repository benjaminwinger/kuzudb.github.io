# SERIAL
`SERIAL` is a logical data type and usually used for creating an incremental sequence of unique identifier column (similar to `AUTO_INCREMENT` supported by some other databases).


### Using `SERIAL` as Primary Key Column
```
CREATE NODE TABLE Person(ID SERIAL, name STRING, PRIMARY KEY(ID));
```

**Node**
`SERIAL` column is expected to be used with `COPY` statement. KÃ¹zu currently doesn't support insert/delete on `SERIAL` column.
