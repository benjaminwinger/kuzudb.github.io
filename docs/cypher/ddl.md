## Defining A Graph Schema: Data Definition Language

As a first step to creating your database, you need to define your node and relationships. Within Kùzu's code base we refer to these as "node and relationship tables". The choice of "table" as a term is intentional because Kùzu, as well as other GDBMSs are ultimately relational in the sense that they store and process sets of tuples, i.e., tables or relations. In GDBMSs that adopt the property graph model, each node and relationship has a label. For example one can model Person and City nodes and LIKES relationships between Person and Person nodes and LIVES_IN relationships between Person and City nodes. Nodes are generally suitable to represent entities in your appliacation data, while relationships represent the relationships/connections. Relationships are the primary means to join nodes with each other to find paths and patterns in your graph database. All of this can equivalently be thought of having two types of tables: node tables and relationship tables with differnet roles in your appliation data. Hence, we use the term node and relationshp tables. The above example can be thought of as having two "node tables" with names Person and City and two " relatinoship tables" with names LIKES and LIVES_IN.
