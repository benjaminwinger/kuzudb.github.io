# Overview
Within many clauses of high-level database query languages,
such as WHERE, WITH, and RETURN in openCypher, you can perform
computations using expressions. Expressions can be very simple or
arbitarily comples. Variables that bind to node and relationship
properties, aliases from previous parts of the query, literal (i.e., constants),
are examples of most simples expressions. Using logical or arithmetic operators,
and functions recursively, you can complex arbitarily complex expressions.

This part of the documentation covers the following operators:
  - [Logical Operators](casting.md)
  - [Comparison Operators](comparisons.md)
  - [Functions](functions/)
