# Overview
Within many clauses of high-level database query languages,
such as WHERE, WITH, and RETURN in openCypher, you can perform
computations using expressions. Expressions can be very simple or
arbitrarily complex. Variables that bind to node and relationship
properties, aliases from previous parts of the query, literals (i.e., constants),
are examples of most simples expressions. Using logical and arithmetic operators,
and functions recursively, you can create arbitrarily complex expressions.
