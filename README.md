# Kuzu Website

This repository hosts the source code for [Kuzu website](https://kuzudb.github.io).

## Building
This website is generated through [Jekyll](https://kuzudb.com/). 

- To install Jekyll, follow the documentation [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).
- To test locally, follow the documentation [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll)
  - Note: If you are using Ruby 3.0 and Jekyll 4.2.x or older (which should be the case if you follow the installation above), run `bundle add webrick` before running `bundle install` 

## Add content
We use [Just The Doc](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs) as our theme. Example usage can be found on their github. To add content, modify existing markdown files or create new ones under `docs/`.
